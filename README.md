# my-first-substrate-project-series-III-part-9

### This project is part of a series and includes a video.

See [Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/blockchain-tutorials/blob/main/README.md) for the overall document that
refers to all the series.  
  
# We Code, Deploy, Interact With A Counter Using The Javascript Client
  
Prior parts (1-8) had more README help - unfortunately, with this last part, you'd have to watch the video or just review the code.  
  
This is the final part for this series III.
